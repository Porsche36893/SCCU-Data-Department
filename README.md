# Student Survey Data Pipeline & Power BI Dashboard
In 2024, I designed and implemented a data pipeline for analyzing student survey responses using Google Forms, Google Sheets, Python, and Power BI.

### Project Workflow:
#### 1. Survey Design & Data Collection
- Created a structured survey using Google Forms to gather insights from students on various topics.
- Integrated responses into Google Sheets for initial storage.
#### 2. Data Preprocessing & Transformation
- Utilized Python to extract data from Google Sheets via its API.
- Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and applying preprocessing techniques.
- Transformed the raw survey data into a structured format for better analysis.
- Stored the processed data in a secondary Google Sheets database.

#### 3. Data Visualization & Live Dashboard
- Connected the processed data to Power BI for real-time visualization.
- Designed interactive dashboards to track key insights and trends dynamically.
- Enabled automatic data refresh to ensure live updates based on new survey responses.

### Key Skills & Tools Used:
✅ Python – Data preprocessing, API handling \
✅ Google Sheets API – Data extraction & storage \
✅ Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation & real-time analytics \
✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation – Handling missing values, structuring data 

This project demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end data pipeline, automate data workflows, and visualize insights effectively.
